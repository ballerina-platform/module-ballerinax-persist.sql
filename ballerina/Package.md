## Package overview

This package includes Ballerina `persist` Tooling, which provides functionality to store and query data conveniently through a data model instead of SQL query language.

The `persist` commands will make it easy to enable Ballerina Persistence Layer in a bal project. With this support, users need not worry about the persistence layer in a project. Users can define an entity data model, validate the model and generate `persist` clients, which provide convenient APIs to store and query data in a data store.
